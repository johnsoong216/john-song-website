I am a fourth year student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science and Economics. I am passionate about data science and particularly its applications in finance. 

I have interned at Capital One and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, where I explored the intersections between machine learning and finance. At university, I worked as a research assistant under [Mark Manger!][http://www.markmanger.net] performing data analysis on labour economics. I am currently working under [Michelle Alexopoulos!][https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/person/person/faculty/2].
