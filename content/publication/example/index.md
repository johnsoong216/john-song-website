  Music composition with complex models has received more attention in recent

  years, fuelled by the rising interests in algorithmic art creations. This project aims to

  generate polyphonic melodies with a linguistic approach, comparing performance

  between variants of hidden Markov models (HMM) and an Encoder-Decoder

  network that uses long-short term memory (LSTM) cells, which are commonly

  used in language generation tasks. The main objective of this project is to construct

  pleasant melodies that sound indistinguishable from human-composed ones. The

  project evaluates the modelsâ€™ performance by both quantitative and qualitative

  measures and discusses possible areas for explorations.
