I am a fourth year student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science and Economics. I have interned at Capital One and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, where I explored the intersections between machine learning and finance. At university, I worked as a research assistant under [Mark Manger](https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/profile/manger-mark/) performing data analysis on labour economics. I am currently working under [Michelle Alexopoulos](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/person/person/faculty/2]) researching the application of natural language processing in analyzing macroeconomic policies.
